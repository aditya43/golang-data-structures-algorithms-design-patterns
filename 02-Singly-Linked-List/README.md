# Singly Linked List
Singly linked list is simply a `List` that holds two pointers:

- `head` -- Points to the head node in the list.
- `tail` -- Points to the tail node in the list.

Each node in the list holds a pointer to the next node and a value:

- `next` -- A pointer to the next connecting node in the list
- `value` -- The underlying value of the node

## Operations

Most operations in a singly linked list are `O(n)` with the exception of insertion and deletion which are both `O(1)`.

### Iteration

Iterating over a singly linked list is easy. Set your initial pointer `curr` to the `head` of the list and repeatedly access the next node in the list by accessing `curr.next` until `curr` is `nil`.

### Reversing

Reversing a singly linked list is also fairly easy to do as you're just swapping the node's pointers for `next` to the previous node as you iterate over the list (//with the initial `prev` being `nil`//). At the start of the iteration the `tail` becomes the list's `head` and once the iteration is complete the `head` becomes the last node pointed at `prev`.
